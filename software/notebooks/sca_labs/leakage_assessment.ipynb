    "## Test Vector Leakage Assessment\n",
    "Unprotected cryptographic implementations leak information if not protected properly using side channel counter measures. To test countermeasure effectiveness, key recovery attacks (e.g DPA) can be mounted at several attack points to see if the key can be recovered. \n",
    "However, mounting such attacks, which includes analyzing the algorithm to find all possible points of attack, coming up with the power models, obtaining the measurements, etc., is time consuming and requires experience with these attacks and detailed knowledge of the implementation. You have been through this for one possible point of attack of an AES implementation in the previous parts of Project 2.\n",
    "Leakage assessment methodologies allow you to quickly determine if there is a significat leakage from the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Welch's T-Test\n",
    "Welch's t-test is a moments-based statistical test used in a wide range of scientific research to show if two populations are significantly different. This test is used in the **Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA)** methodology which has been used in many publications to test if there is significant information leakage from an implementation.  \n",
    "If an implementation is secure against DPA, its power consumption must be independent of the algorithm's intermediate values. This implies that power traces collected when processing fixed data and traces collected when processing random data should be statistically indistinguishable. We call the two trace sets $Q_f$ and $Q_r$ respectively. A $t$ value is calculated as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\mu_f - \\mu_r}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_f^2}{n_f} + \\frac{s_r^2}{n_r}}}     \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_f$ and $\\mu_r$ are the means, $s_f$ and $s_r$ are the standard deviations and $n_f$ and $n_r$ are the number of samples in the sets. \n",
    "The **null hypothesis** is that the means of the two trace sets $Q_f$ and $Q_r$ are equal (i.e.,  the two trace sets are indistinguishable). We use the calculated $t$ value as an indicator to reject the null hypothesis at certain confidence level. If $\\mid t \\mid > 4.5 $ we reject the null hypothesis at a confidence level of $99.999\\%$ (i.e., $p<10^{-5}$). This means the two sets $Q_f$ and $Q_r$ are distinguishable and the cryptographic core is likely leaking information. However, this doesn't prove that the leakage can be exploited to obtain secret information, and it doesn't recover any secret information itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of doing such a test is to give the countermeasure designer more confidence on the soundness of the protection. However, recent research has shown that even implementations passing the t-test can leak information in ways the t-test does not capture. More advanced test have been therfore developed. Never the less, TVLA is still a powerful tool and the first test to be performed for SCA leakage evaluation."

    "## Leakage Analysis Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leakage analysis process is much simpler and shorter than the side channel analysis process. It consists of only two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Acquisition - Power Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure the power consumption of the crypto device (DUT) while it encrypts $n_f$ data blocks with the same fixed value and $n_r$ data blocks with random values. The total number of data blocks is $D=n_f+n_r$. These values can be written as a vector $\\mathbf{d} = [d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_D]$. The fixed and random data blocks are randomly interleaved as the power consumption of processing the current data block might have some dependencies on the data of the previous data block. One data block i.e., plain text of the same size as the cryptographic algorithms input size in the format that the hardware implementation requires, is called a test vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single power measurement value obtained from an oscilloscope or ADC is called a sample.\n",
    "All samples collected during the encryption or decryption of a single data block comprise a trace.\n",
    "The trace generated while encrypting or decrypting a data block $d_i$ consists of $T$ samples and can be viewed as a vector $\\mathbf{t}_i = [t_{i,1}, t_{i,2}, \\ldots, t_{i,T}]$.\n",
    "The traces are stacked in a matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ with dimensions $D \\times T$ where each row $i$ is a trace generated while encrypting or decrypting block $d_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Analysis - Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The collected traces $\\mathbf{T}$ will be split into two trace sets, one, $Q_f$ comprised of all traces recorded when the fixed data blocks were encrypted and the other one, $Q_r$ with all the traces recorded when random data blocks were encrypted. The Welche's T-test is applied to see if we can distinguish between the two sets."
