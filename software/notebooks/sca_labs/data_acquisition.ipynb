    "Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) is a variant of power side channel analysis that collects many power traces while the device under test (DUT) is performing a cryptographic operation. The attacker selects an attack point where an intermediate value is calculated in the device. The intermeadiate value should be a function of known data (e.g. plaintext) and a small portion of the key, called a *subkey*. The attacker uses all possible values of the subkey to calculate the possible values of the intermediate. A power model (e.g. Hamming weight or distance) is used to calculate power estimates proportional to the actual power consumption of the device when the device computes the intermediate values. These power estimates are called the hypothetical power.\n",
    "The real power traces collected are statistically correlated with the hypothetical power to find the key portion most likley used in the crypto operation."

    "FOBOS stands for *Flexible Open-sources workBench fOr Side-channel analysis* and was developed by the [Cryptographic Engineering Research Group (CERG)](https://cryptography.gmu.edu) at GMU. FOBOS, loosely named after the Greek god Phobos (φóβoς) who personifies fear and can pierce shields, was designed to be an inexpensive side channel analysis setup that includes a complete software package with programs for device under test (DUT) control, data acquisition and data analysis. In order to evaluate side-channel leakage of hardware platforms, FOBOS uses off-the shelf FPGA boards as\n",

FOBOS3 uses a data acquisition board called *FOBOS Shield* designed by CERG with an Analog to Digital Converver (ADC) which enables measurements of power consumption and replaces the oscilloscope of traditional setups. Communication with the PC is handled via Ethernet.\n",

    "For this lab we provide Internet access to a Side-Channel Analysis setup composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SCA workstation**: This is the machine that you are currently running this Jupyter notebook on. The SCA workstation runs all capture and analysis scripts. To collect traces, you run a script that connects to the control board via network, sends test vectors, comprised of plaintext and key, one at a time, and receives results (ciphertext) and power consumption traces back from the control board. Results and traces are stored as files in the SCA workstation for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FOBOS3 control board**: Receives test vectors from the SCA workstation and forwards them to the DUT. Once the DUT starts processing a test vector, i.e., its running the crypto algorithm, the control board collects the instantaneous power consumption changes of the DUT using a current probe. The control board also generates the clock signal for the DUT and controls the trigger signal (used to trigger ADC / oscilloscope to collect a trace)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DUT board**: Here we instantiate the crypto core (a.k.a victim: AES-128) which we want to attack. We need to measure the power consumption of this board. We are using a Digilent Nexys 3 board (which contains a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA) as a DUT board.\n",

The DUT gets the core voltage for the FPGA from a *lab power supply*. The core voltage passes through a *Current Probe* so that changes in the current consumption of the DUT can be measured by the ADC on the *FOBOS Shield*. The SCA workstation hosts this jupyter notebook and talks to *Fobos Control* via a *Network Interface*.\n",

    "\n",
    "First we need to choose a point during the run time of the crypto algorithm in which we want to attack, i.e., the *Attack Point*. We choose it to be the point in time where an intermediate result is computed as a funcion of a known data value and the key. The intermediate value is calculated as *f(d, k)* where *d* is a known non-constant value that can be derived from known data, typically plaintext or ciphertext, and *k* is small part of the key, the so called *subkey*. \n",
    "\n",
    "AES applies four different transformations, SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey, per round and iterates through several such rounds depending upon the key size. An intermediate key called \"round key\" is generated and used per round which is derived from the original key through a key scheduling function. We have implemented a basic iterative architecture of AES with 128-bit key length and 128-bit wide datapath requiring 11 clock cycles for one encryption. Key scheduling is done on-the-fly and the SubBytes function is realized through look-up-tables. The image below shows the block diagram of the AES-128 that we attack in this project. \n",

A change in values at the output of FF1 leads to power being consumed by the linear ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey functions, as well as by the non-linear S-Box. \n",
    "\n",
    "During round 11 of encrypting plaintext $PT_i$, i.e. during the last round of AES, the AES state in FF1 goes through the ShiftRows function, skipps MixColumns, and continues through AddRoundKey to produce the ciphertext $CT_i$ at the input of the output register FF2. At the same time, $CT_i$ also propagates through SubBytes to FF1. FF1 stores the value of $SBOX(CT_i)$.\n",

    "The next clock cycle is the 1st round of encrypting plaintext $PT_{i+1}$. A new plaintext block is inputed, goes through AddRoundKey, SubBytes and to FF1. Now FF1 stores the value of \n",
    "$f(d_i,k)=SBOX(PT_{i+1} \\oplus k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know the output of FF1 during two consecutive clock cycles of AES, we can use the Hamming Distance Model to model the power consumption. We select the first subkey and compute the hypothetical power model for each key guess $k_j$ and for all data values $d_i$, i.e., for all plaintext that we try, using the Hamming Distance (HD) equation below. This equation is directly derived from the equations we determined above for the output of FF1 during 2 consecutive clock cycles.\n",
