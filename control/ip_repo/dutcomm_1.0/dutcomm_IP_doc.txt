DUTCOMM IP Register Space:

0x00 Reserved  
0x04 Status register. 32 bit.
     Value indicates the state of the controller FSM
     --status codes
     IDLE        x"01"  Idle)
     C_TX_VALID  x"02"  waiting for tx_valid signal
     WAIT_READY  x"05"  waiting for di_ready from DUT
     SND         x"0a"  sending data to DUT
     WAIT_VALID  x"0f"  waitng for do_valid from DUT
     RCV         x"15"  receiving data
     DONE        x"1a"  operation finished

0x08 Interface selection. (read-write). 32 bit.
     If bit0 = 1, use 8-bit interface.
     If bit0 = 0, use 4-bit interface.

0x0C Expected output length register. (read-write). 32 bit.
     Used to set the number of output bytes to be expected from DUT.
     This is used to generate the tlast signal used to mark the end of
     the packet.
